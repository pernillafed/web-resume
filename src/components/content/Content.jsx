                        <p>I started my journey at Massive as an intern while I was still in school and it later turned into the employment I have today. I'm part of a team working on Ubisoft's online player network - Ubisoft Connect. We work with an agile method similar to SCRUM, which means I have a lot of experience participating in agile ceremonies. Other job assignments includes developing new features, fixing bugs, writing unit tests and documentation, and doing code review. I have also been part of a group developing an accessibility prototype from one of our applications. This was part of a project aiming towards giving us more insight and knowledge in web accessibility.</p>

                            I was stationed at the terminal office in the harbor and answered incoming emails and calls from customers, helped them book a trip or answered various questions about booking and traveling. I also worked in the terminal where I checked in private passengers. At Finnlines, I further developed my customer service skills, and I became very comfortable talking to people on the phone. I also learned to master programs, such as eBooking and Net e-payments.

                        <p>
                            At the beginning of my preschool teacher career, I learned a lot about what it actually means to be a preschool teacher, everything from childcare to administrative work. I was also part of a team that dealt with questions about information and communication technology. As a preschool teacher, I planned and performed educational work according to the preschool curriculum's goals to aim for, and supported the children in their personal and educational development. During my time as a preschool teacher, I have learned a lot about meeting different types of people, as well as the importance of routines and good structure. At Arvidsborg, I also developed new daily routines and activity plans.
